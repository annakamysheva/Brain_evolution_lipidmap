# Lipidmap of human brain evolution 

R scriptes for analysis performed in [Laboratory of E.Khrameeva](https://faculty.skoltech.ru/people/ekaterinakhrameeva) at [Skoltech](https://www.skoltech.ru/).
This study is aimed to determin specific traits in the organization of human brain lipidom which occured during its evolution and separated human from other primates. 
We are also looking for molecular mechanism underlying this changes by performing comparative analysis of transcriptomics.
